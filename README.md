# Electricity analysis

Get data from RTE and do some analysis on grid data

## Get started

Download all .csv needed in \_data and make output directories

```bash
./postBuild
```

Go to a numeroted folder and launch `RScript index.r` to generate figures.

I recommend to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
