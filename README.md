# Electricity analysis

Get data from RTE and do some analysis on grid data

## Get started

Download all .csv needed in 0_data and make output directories
```bash
./init.sh
```

Go to a numeroted folder and launch ```RScript index.r``` to generate figures.

I recommend to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
